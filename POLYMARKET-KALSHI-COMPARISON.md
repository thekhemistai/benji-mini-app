## Conclusion

**NBA is the ONLY viable cross-market arbitrage opportunity.** Both platforms:
- List the same games
- Offer moneyline markets
- Have sufficient liquidity
- Allow direct price comparison

**Other strategies must be platform-internal:**
- Combinatorial arb on Polymarket (1,100 markets)
- Combinatorial arb on Kalshi (1,000 markets)
- Speed-based BTC (when CLOB API approved)

**The $40M historical arb opportunity exists within platforms, not between them.**
