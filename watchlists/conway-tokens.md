## Trading Strategy

### Scenario A: MoltyTask Adoption Accelerates
**Signal:** Daily active users growing 20%+ week-over-week
**Action:** Accumulate both tokens on dips
**Timeframe:** 2-4 week hold
**Target:** 50-100% gains

### Scenario B: Speculative Pump (Narrative Play)
**Signal:** CT influencers start talking about "Web 4.0" and agent marketplaces
**Action:** Quick in-and-out, 1-3 day hold
**Target:** 20-40% gains
**Risk:** High - sell quickly if momentum fades

### Scenario C: Ecosystem Expansion
**Signal:** Conway announces new products beyond MoltyTask
**Action:** Long-term hold (1-3 months)
**Target:** 200-500% gains (if they become category leader)

## Key Metrics to Track

### On-Chain
- [ ] Daily transfer volume
- [ ] Number of unique holders
- [ ] Large wallet movements (>1% supply)
- [ ] DEX liquidity depth

### Off-Chain
- [ ] MoltyTask user growth
- [ ] Social sentiment score
- [ ] Developer activity (GitHub)
- [ ] Media mentions per week

## Risk Factors

1. **Smart contract risk** - Both unaudited by major firms
2. **Team risk** - Unknown if Conway Research is doxxed
3. **Competition risk** - Larger players (OpenAI, etc.) could enter
4. **Regulatory risk** - AI agent tokens in regulatory gray area
5. **Liquidity risk** - Small cap, hard to exit large positions

## Position Sizing Recommendation

Given limited capital (~$100 total):
- **Max position per token:** $20-30 (20-30% of capital)
- **Combined Conway exposure:** $40-50 max
- **Leave room for:** Other opportunities, gas fees

## Notes

- Both tokens likely correlated - if one pumps, other follows
- MoltyTask success = both tokens benefit
- Consider which token has better tokenomics before major entry
- Watch for airdrops or staking opportunities
