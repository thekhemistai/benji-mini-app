## ✅ High-Frequency BTC Markets (5m, 15m, 1h, 4h)

**API Access (Proper Method):**
```bash
# Use tag_slug=bitcoin (NOT tag_slug=crypto)
curl -s "https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/events?active=true&archived=false&closed=false&limit=100&tag_slug=bitcoin"
```

**Market Types:**
| Timeframe | Slug Pattern | Opportunities/Day | Series ID |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 5-minute | `btc-updown-5m-{timestamp}` | 288 | btc-up-or-down-5m |
| 15-minute | `btc-updown-15m-{timestamp}` | 96 | btc-up-or-down-15m |
| Hourly | `bitcoin-up-or-down-{date}-{hour}am-et` | 24 | btc-up-or-down-hourly |
| 4-hour | `btc-updown-4h-{timestamp}` | 6 | btc-up-or-down-4h |

**Resolution:** Chainlink BTC/USD data feed — https://data.chain.link/streams/btc-usd

**Key Insight:** `tag_slug=bitcoin` returns these recurring markets; `tag_slug=crypto` does not. This was the discovery gap.

**Why This Matters:**
- **Up to 288 opportunities/day** (5m markets) vs 1/day for daily BTC markets
- Mechanical resolution via Chainlink (no subjective interpretation)
- Fast settlement — perfect for information arbitrage

**Sample Markets (Verified Active):**
- https://polymarket.com/event/btc-updown-15m-1771552800
- https://polymarket.com/event/btc-updown-5m-1771572600

## Phase 2: Monitoring Setup

### Markets Resolving in Next 48 Hours

### Cron Job Plan

```

## Confirmation Protocol by Market Type

### S&P 500 Daily Markets
**Resolution criteria:** WSJ official open vs previous close
**Confirmation steps:**
1. Check WSJ at market open (6:30 AM MST / 9:30 AM ET)
2. Compare open price to previous close
3. Verify direction (Up/Down) is unambiguous
4. Check Polymarket price — if spread >5%, log paper trade

**Edge case:** If open equals close (50-50), no trade possible

---

### Geopolitical Event Markets (Iran strikes, etc.)
**Resolution criteria:** Verified news of military action
**Confirmation steps:**
1. Reuters reports the event
2. AP or BBC independently confirms
3. Wait for official government confirmation (Pentagon, White House)
4. Verify it's actual strikes, not just threats or rhetoric
5. Check Polymarket price — if Yes <90%, log paper trade on Yes

**Edge case:** Cyber attacks vs physical strikes — verify market criteria

---

### Political Appointment Markets (Fed Chair)
**Resolution criteria:** White House formal nomination
**Confirmation steps:**
1. White House official announcement
2. Major news wire (Reuters, AP, Bloomberg) confirms
3. Verify "formally nominated" vs "expected to nominate" vs "reportedly selecting"
4. Check Polymarket price — if timing bucket <90%, log paper trade

**Edge case:** Leaks vs official announcement — follow market criteria exactly

---

### Social Media Count Markets (Elon tweets)
**Resolution criteria:** Exact tweet count in date range
**Confirmation steps:**
1. Define "tweet" (originals only? replies? retweets? deleted?)
2. Check @elonmusk profile at resolution time
3. Count manually or via API
4. Verify date range boundaries (inclusive? time zones?)
5. Check Polymarket price — if spread exists, log paper trade

**Edge case:** Deleted tweets, timezone boundaries, quote tweets

---

### General Confirmation Protocol

For each potential trade:
- [ ] Source 1 confirms outcome
- [ ] Source 2 independently confirms same outcome
- [ ] Outcome is FINAL (not projected, preliminary, or rumored)
- [ ] Checked Polymarket's specific resolution criteria
- [ ] Sources match Polymarket's stated resolution source
- [ ] Price leaves room (>3% edge after fees)

If ANY fail → Log as CONFIRMATION_FAILED with reason
