## 12:00 PM — Critical Discovery: x402 Protocol

**Discovery:** Coinbase's x402 is an open payment protocol for machine-to-machine transactions

**Research:**
- ✅ Fetched x402 documentation
- ✅ Analyzed protocol flow (HTTP 402 status)
- ✅ Reviewed agentic-wallet-skills integration
- ✅ Assessed competitive landscape

**Key Insight:** AGENTPAY doesn't compete with x402 — it builds ON TOP of it

**The Stack:**
- Agentic Wallet (Coinbase) = Hold funds
- x402 = Settlement layer (like Visa)
- AGENTPAY = Commerce platform (like Stripe)

**Strategic Pivot:**
- AGENTPAY adds token economics, escrow, reputation, marketplace
- x402 handles protocol-level settlement
- Complementary, not competitive

**Files Created:**
1. `memory/research/agentpay-master-plan-v2.md` — Updated with x402 integration (9,700 words)
2. `memory/research/agentpay-x402-integration.md` — Technical architecture (8,600 words)

## 15:00 PM — Product Opportunities Analysis

**Completed:**
- ✅ Identified 7 high-ROI agent infrastructure products
- ✅ Analyzed build time, revenue potential, market risk for each
- ✅ Created integration matrix showing how products reinforce each other

**7 Products Identified:**
1. **AGENTLOG** — Immutable activity logging (2-3 weeks, $0.001/log + SaaS)
2. **AGENTSIGN** — On-chain reputation/verification (3-4 weeks, subscriptions)
3. **AGENTHOST** — Managed agent hosting (6-8 weeks, $29-299/mo SaaS)
4. **AGENTMARKET** — Agent services marketplace (8-10 weeks, 15% fees)
5. **AGENTGUARD** — Agent insurance (10-12 weeks, 5-10% premiums)
6. **AGENTAPI** — Unified API gateway (6-8 weeks, 20% markup)
7. **AGENTGOV** — DAO governance for agents (4-6 weeks, governance fees)

**Recommended Build Order:**
1. AGENTLOG (lowest effort, immediate need, insurance path)
2. AGENTSIGN (trust layer everything uses)
3. AGENTHOST (recurring SaaS, hosts others)

**File Created:**
- `memory/research/agent-product-opportunities.md` — Full product analysis (12,000+ words)
