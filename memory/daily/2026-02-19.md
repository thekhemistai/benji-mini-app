## Decisions Made

1. **Prioritize crypto arb over Elon tweets.** Creator directed: forget Elon, focus on BTC/SOL/ETH markets. → Removed from active tasks.
2. **Run all subagents on Kimi** ($36/month SOUL.md cost identified as significant). → Cost optimization for spawned agents.
3. **Log trades without asking** — "Don't ask, just log." → Protocol change for paper trading data collection.

## State Changes

| System | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Market Discovery | `tag_slug=crypto` (broken) | `tag_slug=bitcoin` (works) — discovered 700+ markets/day |
| Resolution Sources | Assumed all Chainlink | **BTC=Chainlink, SOL=Binance** (different sources!) |
| Paper Trades | 1 (pre-resolution, INVALID) | 2 (1 valid post-resolution arb logged) |
| Watchlist | 5 markets | Full universe: BTC (414/day) + SOL (312/day) + ETH (TBD) |
| Tools | Manual API scraping | Polymarket live charts + Bankr CLI identified as primary |

## Lessons Learned

1. **Arb protocol correction:** Pre-resolution entry = gambling. Post-resolution entry (within 30-60s) = true arbitrage. Invalidated Trade #2, corrected approach.
2. **Speed > prediction:** Confirmed edge is seeing resolution faster than market, not predicting direction. Trade #3 logged DOWN at 91.5¢ when market knew outcome but hadn't settled to $1.00.
3. **API tag specificity:** `tag_slug=bitcoin` returns recurring markets; `tag_slug=crypto` returns sports/politics. Read docs properly.
4. **Multi-source resolution:** Different assets use different feeds (BTC=Chainlink, SOL=Binance). Must track which uses which.

## Blockers Identified

| Blocker | Impact | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Subagent rate limits (Brave API) | Can't spawn Counterweight/Market-Maker for parallel work | ❌ Active — using main session instead |
| Browser instability | Gateway restart required mid-session | ⚠️ Intermittent — auto-restart works |
| ETH resolution source unverified | Can't complete full 700+ market map | 🔄 Pending — need to query `tag_slug=ethereum` |
| Bankr CLI timeouts | Slow for real-time price checks | ⚠️ Using direct API + Coingecko fallback |

---

## Task Commitments

- [ ] Verify ETH resolution source (Chainlink vs Binance)
- [ ] Build unified multi-asset monitor (BTC + SOL + ETH)
- [ ] Set up continuous opportunity scanner (next 10 markets to resolve)
- [ ] Log 8 more paper trades (target: 10 total for analysis)

## Strategic Pivots

| From | To | Trigger |
|------|-----|---------|
| Single-asset (BTC only) | Multi-asset (BTC+SOL+ETH) | Creator: "not just for btc" |
| Pre-resolution "trading" | Post-resolution arbitrage | Realized was gambling, not arbing |
| Manual API queries | Polymarket live charts | Discovered charts show real-time price feeds |
| Claude for subagents | Kimi for subagents | Cost optimization ($36/month SOUL.md concern) |
