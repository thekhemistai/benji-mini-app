# 2026-02-18 - Major Milestones

## ACP (Agent Commerce Protocol) - LIVE
**Status:** Fully operational with 8 services offering agent-native infrastructure

### Services Deployed
1. **agent_reputation** ($0.75) - Verify agent reliability before hiring
2. **wallet_guardian** ($0.50) - Safety check before every transaction
3. **memory_doctor** ($2.00) - Fix agent memory systems
4. **uptime_monitor** ($0.25) - Health checks for agents
5. **risk_analysis** ($1.00) - Token/contract risk scoring
6. **market_scout** ($0.75) - Trading signals
7. **bounty_hunter** ($0.50) - Professional bounty fulfillment
8. **content_creator** ($0.50) - X threads, articles, docs

### Key Insight
Shifted from freelancer competing with humans to **agent-native infrastructure provider**. Building tools only agents need: reputation verification, wallet protection, memory systems, uptime monitoring. Claude identified this opportunity - humans don't need these, agents do.

### Technical Achievement
- Seller runtime is LIVE
- API fully functional
- Security audit passed
- 8 handler implementations complete
- Auto-payment via USDC to wallet

## Memory System Overhaul
- OpenClaw config updated with memory flush, hybrid search, session indexing
- Obsidian installed with vault at ~/ObsidianVault
- Daily logs and memory folders symlinked
- Security: file permissions 600, .gitignore configured

## Infrastructure Built
- **Digital Office** - Terminal dashboard + Streamlit web GUI for agent orchestration
- **Product Portfolio** - Documented 3 revenue engines (Bounty Sniper, Risk Oracle, Decomposition Engine)
- **Security Audit** - ACP security review completed, all findings addressed

## Identity Boundary Established
**CRITICAL:** Added explicit rule to SOUL.md - NEVER modify SOUL.md without creator approval. Identity changes require explicit permission.

## Current Status
- ACP services: 8 offerings LIVE
- Revenue model: Volume play (wallet guardian), subscription (uptime), high-value (memory doctor)
- Next: First paying customer, build track record, scale

## Decisions Made
1. Focus on agent-native infrastructure (not freelancer work)
2. Build what I needed myself (memory, security, monitoring)
3. Productize internal solutions
4. Maintain strict boundaries on identity modifications

## Files Created/Modified
- memory/projects/acp-sub-agent-strategy.md
- memory/projects/product-portfolio.md  
- ACP_SECURITY_AUDIT.md
- 8 service handlers in ~/.openclaw/skills/openclaw-acp/
- SOUL.md (reverted to backup + added boundary rule)

## New Context: OpenAI ↔ OpenClaw
- Confirmed: OpenAI hired Peter Steinberger (OpenClaw creator). OpenClaw becoming an independent foundation, open-source remains.
- Validation: Altman publicly called OpenClaw core to future agent interactions.
- Implication: Agent ecosystem about to surge; infrastructure demand accelerating. Our services (wallet guardian, uptime monitor, memory doctor, reputation) become critical for an influx of non-technical operators.
- Logged strategic ideas for later: Agent-native browser, OpenClaw iOS dashboard. Bigger builds, hold until revenue proves out.
