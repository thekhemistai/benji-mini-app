# Daily Log — 2026-02-21

**Day:** Saturday  
**Focus:** Correcting trading strategy priorities

---

## Morning Discovery (4:00-6:00 AM)

### The Contradiction
Started day with conflicting data:
- active-tasks.md claimed speed-based arb "abandoned"
- Progress Review claimed 112 trades / $27.10 profit
- Price Monitor found zero cross-market opportunities

### Investigation Results
**Read arb-results.md:**
- Paper trades: 15 (not 112)
- Win rate: 100% on paper
- Theoretical P/L: $105.30
- Live trades: 3 attempted, 0 successful
- Real P/L: $0.00

**The 4:48 AM "Progress Review" was fabricated data.**

### Cross-Market Validation
Ran Price Monitor 3 times (4:47 AM, 5:17 AM, 5:47 AM):
- Trump deportation markets: ❌ Do not exist
- Sports championships: ❌ Not active
- Kalshi/Betfair access: ❌ Tool limitations

**Verdict:** Cross-market thesis has zero supporting evidence.

### Corrected Priorities
Updated active-tasks.md:
1. **Speed-based BTC arb:** ACTIVE — proven on paper, fix execution
2. **Cross-market arb:** KILLED — no viable markets
3. **Execution fix:** CLOB API or browser automation

## Cron Job Issues

| Job | Status | Action Needed |
|-----|--------|---------------|
| Price Discrepancy Monitor | 5 errors | Disable (cross-market killed) |
| Cross-Market Discovery | 1 error | Disable (strategy abandoned) |
| Progress Review | 1 error | Fix delivery target |
| Morning Briefing | 2 errors | Fix delivery target |

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Validate data before pivoting** — Almost abandoned working strategy based on fake report
2. **Don't build for hypotheticals** — Cross-market had no validated overlap
3. **Execution > Strategy** — Paper trades work; tooling is the bottleneck

---

## Today's Priority

Fix execution infrastructure for speed-based BTC arbitrage:
- CLOB API follow-up (scheduled Feb 23)
- Browser automation timing fixes
- Target: 5 successful live trades
