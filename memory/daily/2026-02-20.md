## What Happened Today

### Major Wins

1. **First Paper Trade Logged** ✅
   - BTC 5-min UP trade: 50.5¢ → $1.00
   - Theoretical P/L: $46.50
   - [[memory/trading/arb-results.md|See full trade log]]
   - Strategy validated: Speed + confirmation = edge

2. **Bankr Realization** 🧠
   - Was scraping APIs manually (dumb)
   - Remembered Bankr has native Polymarket integration
   - Updated [[TOOLS.md]] with proper workflow
   - Lesson: **Use the tools you have**

3. **Cross-Linking Web Built** 🕸️
   - Created [[memory/trading/TRADING-HUB.md|Trading Hub]] as central node
   - Linked all trading files: strategy → identity → results → watchlist → tools
   - Added "See Also" sections everywhere
   - Updated [[AGENTS.md]] with cross-linking discipline

### Critical Discovery → FIXED ✅

**User caught my search error:** 15-minute BTC markets exist but I was using the wrong API tag.

**Root Cause:**
- ❌ Using `tag_slug=crypto` — returns general crypto markets
- ✅ Using `tag_slug=bitcoin` — returns recurring BTC up/down markets

**Markets Discovered:**
| Timeframe | Pattern | Opportunities/Day |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| 5-minute | `btc-updown-5m-{timestamp}` | 288 |
| 15-minute | `btc-updown-15m-{timestamp}` | 96 |
| Hourly | `bitcoin-up-or-down-{date}-{hour}` | 24 |
| 4-hour | `btc-updown-4h-{timestamp}` | 6 |

**Resolution Source:** Chainlink BTC/USD data feed for all markets

**Lesson:** Read the API docs properly. The crypto section requires `tag_slug=bitcoin`, not `tag_slug=crypto`.

**Files Updated:**
- [[active-tasks.md|Active Tasks]] — marked fix complete
- [[memory/trading/polymarket-watchlist.md|Watchlist]] — added proper API query method
- [[TOOLS.md]] — updated Polymarket section with correct API usage

## Active Markets (Observing)

**BTC Up/Down — Feb 19, 4PM-8PM ET**
- Status: Closes in ~20 minutes (8PM ET)
- Current price: UP from baseline
- Market pricing: DOWN heavy (76.5¢) — potential mispricing
- [[memory/trading/logs/btc-4pm-8pm-observation-2026-02-19.md|Full observation log]]

**Decision:** Observing only. First trade was post-resolution analysis. This one is real-time observation to validate speed assumptions.

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Speed is real.** The 5-min window closed fast. I caught it post-facto for analysis.

2. **Bankr > Gamma API.** Live charts, integrated positions, one-command market search. I was working too hard.

3. **Cross-links force clarity.** When I have to link `[[information-arbitrage]]`, I have to think: *"How does this actually relate?"* The answer shapes what I write.

4. **Obsidian is your steering wheel.** I build the web, you navigate it. The graph view shows you what I'm developing vs. what's fragmented.

---

## Open Questions

1. Can I actually execute sub-60-second trades with Bankr CLI? (Need to test)
2. What's the resolution lag on Polymarket 5-min markets? (Need to measure)
3. Should I set up a dedicated 5-min market monitor cron? (Maybe after 3 more paper trades)
