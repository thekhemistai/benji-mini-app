**Date:** February 20, 2026  
**Session Focus:** Polymarket Paper Trading — Information Arbitrage  
**Model:** Kimi (moonshot/kimi-k2.5) for all subagents  
**Related:** [[memory/trading/sessions/paper-session-2026-02-20.md|Paper Trading Session]]

## Summary

Launched systematic paper trading operation for Polymarket BTC up/down markets. Target: Log 3-5 trades today to build sample size for strategy validation.

**Markets Identified:**
- 15m windows: Chainlink resolution, ~96 opportunities/day
- Hourly windows: Binance resolution, 24 opportunities/day  
- Total: 120+ arb opportunities/day on BTC alone

**Key Discovery:** Different timeframes use different resolution sources:
- 5m/15m: Chainlink BTC/USD
- Hourly: Binance BTC/USDT

This means parallel monitoring protocols are required.

## Session Start (04:56 UTC)

**Actions:**
1. ✅ Read Trading Hub + Watchlist + Results
2. ✅ Queried Bankr for active BTC markets
3. ✅ Identified 15m and hourly markets via web_fetch
4. ✅ Recorded start price for 05:15 UTC window ($67,233)
5. ✅ Spawned Market-Maker subagent (Kimi) to monitor 05:15 close
6. ✅ Created monitoring scripts (btc-15m-monitor.sh, paper-trade-logger.sh)
7. ✅ Updated session log with 4-hour window schedule

**Infrastructure Created:**
- `memory/trading/sessions/paper-session-2026-02-20.md` — Session tracking
- `scripts/btc-15m-monitor.sh` — Automated window monitoring
- `scripts/paper-trade-logger.sh` — Trade logging utility

## Insights

**What Worked:**
- Bankr for market discovery (reliable, fast)
- web_fetch for market verification (when browser relay down)
- Direct URL construction for short-term markets (btc-updown-15m-{ts})

**Challenges:**
- Gamma API not returning short-term market data (possibly filtered)
- Browser relay temporarily unavailable
- Historical price APIs inconsistent for 15m candles

**Protocol Refinement:**
- Must record start price BEFORE window opens
- Need <30s confirmation speed post-close
- Polymarket price check must happen within 60s of resolution

---

## Next Steps

1. ⏳ Await 05:15 UTC window close and subagent report
2. ⏳ Queue monitoring for 05:30, 05:45, 06:00 UTC windows
3. ⏳ Log first paper trade (targeting 3-5 today)
4. ⏳ Analyze edge capture vs. time-to-confirmation

## Evening Session: Polymarket Official Agents Framework

**Time:** 22:20 UTC  
**Task:** Extract useful components from Polymarket's official agents repo

### What Was Done

1. **Cloned and analyzed** https://github.com/polymarket/agents
2. **Identified useful patterns:**
   - Gamma API client structure (cleaner pagination)
   - Pydantic data models (type safety)
   - CLI pattern with Typer
   - Environment-based config

3. **Identified anti-patterns for arb:**
   - RAG-based market filtering (too slow)
   - LLM prediction engine (wrong strategy entirely)
   - News sentiment analysis (irrelevant for arb)

4. **Created adaptation:**
   - `khem_arb/polymarket.py` — Streamlined Gamma client for arb
   - `khem_arb/__init__.py` — Module exports
   - `khem_arb/requirements.txt` — Lightweight deps
   - `memory/research/polymarket-official-agents-extraction.md` — Full analysis

### Key Insight

Their framework is built for *prediction agents.* The RAG + LLM stack adds seconds of latency. Arb requires milliseconds.

**Take the good parts:** API clients, data models, CLI patterns.  
**Leave the rest:** LLM prediction, sentiment analysis, vector DBs.

Different games entirely.
