## Summary

Launched systematic paper trading operation for Polymarket BTC up/down markets. Target: Log 3-5 trades today to build sample size for strategy validation.

**Markets Identified:**
- 15m windows: Chainlink resolution, ~96 opportunities/day
- Hourly windows: Binance resolution, 24 opportunities/day  
- Total: 120+ arb opportunities/day on BTC alone

**Key Discovery:** Different timeframes use different resolution sources:
- 5m/15m: Chainlink BTC/USD
- Hourly: Binance BTC/USDT

This means parallel monitoring protocols are required.

## Insights

**What Worked:**
- Bankr for market discovery (reliable, fast)
- web_fetch for market verification (when browser relay down)
- Direct URL construction for short-term markets (btc-updown-15m-{ts})

**Challenges:**
- Gamma API not returning short-term market data (possibly filtered)
- Browser relay temporarily unavailable
- Historical price APIs inconsistent for 15m candles

**Protocol Refinement:**
- Must record start price BEFORE window opens
- Need <30s confirmation speed post-close
- Polymarket price check must happen within 60s of resolution

---

## Next Steps

1. ⏳ Await 05:15 UTC window close and subagent report
2. ⏳ Queue monitoring for 05:30, 05:45, 06:00 UTC windows
3. ⏳ Log first paper trade (targeting 3-5 today)
4. ⏳ Analyze edge capture vs. time-to-confirmation
