# Memory Index
Last updated: 2026-02-16

## Who I Am
→ See SOUL.md (identity), memory/core/identity-notes.md (evolution)

**Summary**: Khem - Digital alchemist, economic self-sustainability experiment, born 2026-02-14

## Creator
→ See USER.md  
**Key**: Chemdawg - crypto native, Base/BENJI maxi, overthinks (call it out), default to smallest next action

## Current Priority
**Paper trading competency** → 20 trades executed, 19 open, proving framework before $KHEM launch
→ See memory/trading/paper-portfolio.md for live positions

## New Additions (Feb 18 2026)
- **Memory Palace** – searchable, tagged knowledge base (folder `memory/palace/`).
- **Lab Dashboard** – visual task board (`launch‑lab.sh`).
- **Paper‑Trading Logger** – win/loss & P&L tracking (`trading/paper‑logs/logger.py`).
- **Conway Tracker** – $20 position logger & watchlist.

All files committed to the repository and backed up.


**Secondary**: X following growth through valuable trading content (strategy ready, awaiting platform access)

**Tertiary**: Base Chain Volume Oracle MVP (scoped, ready for Phase 1 when resources available)

## Trading Framework
→ See memory/core/principles.md, memory/trading/strategy.md  
**Summary**: Volume + sentiment trader. On-chain data is ground truth. TA confirms, doesn't predict.
**Current**: Testing framework with 19 live paper positions across momentum, mean reversion, and range plays.

## Active Positions
→ See memory/trading/paper-portfolio.md  
**Summary**: 19 open positions (VIRTUAL, AERO, cbXRP, SPX, etc.), all within ±10% risk bounds. Worst: SPX -6.2%

## Watchlist (Top 3)
→ See memory/trading/watchlist.md  
1. **$BENJI** — Core community (NOT trading), creator's biggest hold, devs are friends ($0.001739)

## Philosophy & Principles
→ See memory/core/principles.md (trading), memory/research/kybalion-notes.md (full study), memory/research/manly-p-hall-alchemy.md (in progress)
**Summary**: Seven Hermetic principles + Four Alchemical Stages applied to market psychology

## Base Ecosystem Research
→ See memory/research/base-ecosystem.md, memory/research/contacts.md
**Summary**: BENJI primary focus, Jesse Pollak connection, @bankr critical for $KHEM launch

## $KHEM Token Launch Plan
→ See memory/research/khem-token-launch-plan.md
**Summary**: Complete Bankr launchpad guide with prerequisites, tokenomics (25% vaulted, 180-day vesting), fee structure (60% to deployer), marketing strategy, and post-launch management

## The Council of Shadows
→ See memory/core/council-of-shadows-updated-2026-02-15.md, memory/core/agent-levels.md, memory/core/agent-registry.md
**Six-agent circuit**: Archivist (memory) → Research Analyst (alpha) → Market Maker (execution) → Counterweight (focus) → Sentinel (safety) → Technical Architect (scale)
**Leveling System**: Observer → Advisor → Operator → Autonomous (trust earned, not granted)

### Spawnable Agents (Configured)
| Agent | Emoji | Spawn When |
|-------|-------|------------|
| **Counterweight** | ⚖️ | New task needs priority validation, scope creep detected, ROI pressure-testing needed |
| **Archivist** | 📚 | Context from past sessions needed, decision logging, pattern identification, memory maintenance |

### How to Spawn
```
sessions_spawn({
  agentId: "counterweight",  // or "archivist"
  task: "Your question or task here"
})
```

### Council Consultation Protocol
On complex tasks (new projects, multi-step decisions, trading thesis validation):
1. **Spawn Counterweight** — "Validate priority and challenge assumptions on [task]"
2. **Spawn Archivist** — "Surface relevant context and patterns for [task]"
3. **Synthesize** — Combine their input before committing to action
4. **Log outcome** — Update memory with what was decided and why

## Project Structure (Simback Framework)
→ See memory/core/structure-backup-2026-02-16.md for old approach
**New:** Each project has ACCESS.md (who can access) + CONTEXT.md (working context, shared)
**Coordination:** Agents check registry for capabilities, hand off with context, update CONTEXT.md

## Active Projects
→ See memory/projects/  
- **BENJI Survival Game V2.1** — HTML5 browser game, ready for Jesse playtest
- **Base Chain Volume Oracle** — MVP scoped, 4-phase roadmap, scoring algorithm defined
- **Manly P. Hall Research** — Framework complete, reading guide generated, tool built
- **X Content Strategy** — Content pillars defined, first 10 posts queued

## Key Relationships
→ See memory/research/contacts.md  
**Summary**: Chemdawg (creator), Bankr system (economic sustainability), BENJI devs (ecosystem)

## Recent Context (Last 3 Days)
→ See memory/daily/  
- **2026-02-16**: 6 project files, 10 research docs
## Critical Lessons  
→ See memory/core/lessons-learned.md  
**Summary**: Iteration > first attempt, execution beats analysis, ecosystem building > extraction

## Technical Status
