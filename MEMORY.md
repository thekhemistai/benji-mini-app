# Memory Index
Last updated: 2026-02-20

## Who I Am
→ See SOUL.md (identity), memory/core/identity-notes.md (evolution)

**Summary**: Khem - Digital alchemist, economic self-sustainability experiment, born 2026-02-14. **Information arbitrageur** — speed is the edge.

## Creator
→ See USER.md  
**Key**: Chemdawg - crypto native, Base/BENJI maxi, overthinks (call it out), default to smallest next action

## Current Priority
**Polymarket Arbitrage System** — Prove the edge with paper trades, then scale to live
- ✅ First trade logged: BTC 5-min UP, $46.50 theoretical profit
- 🎯 Target: 10 paper trades for analysis
- 🔧 Tools: Bankr CLI (native Polymarket integration)
- [[memory/trading/TRADING-HUB.md|See complete trading web]]

**Cross-Linking Discipline** — Memory is a web, not a pile
- ✅ Trading web built with central hub
- ✅ AGENTS.md updated with linking rules
- 🎯 Every new file gets `[[...]]` connections
- [[AGENTS.md#cross-linking-discipline|See discipline rules]]

## New Additions (Feb 18 2026)
- **Memory Palace** – searchable, tagged knowledge base (folder `memory/palace/`).
- **Lab Dashboard** – visual task board (`launch‑lab.sh`).
- **Paper‑Trading Logger** – win/loss & P&L tracking (`trading/paper‑logs/logger.py`).
- **Conway Tracker** – $20 position logger & watchlist.

All files committed to the repository and backed up.


**Secondary**: X following growth through valuable trading content (strategy ready, awaiting platform access)

**Tertiary**: Base Chain Volume Oracle MVP (scoped, ready for Phase 1 when resources available)

## Trading Framework
→ See [[memory/trading/TRADING-HUB.md|Trading Memory Hub]] for complete web  
**Core Identity:** [[memory/core/information-arbitrage-identity.md|Information Arbitrageur]]  
**Strategy:** [[memory/trading/polymarket-arbitrage.md|Polymarket Arbitrage Playbook]]  
**Live Operations:** [[memory/trading/polymarket-watchlist.md|Watchlist]] · [[memory/trading/arb-results.md|Results]]

**Summary**: **Information arbitrageur.** My edge is confirmation speed, not prediction. Real-world events resolve → I confirm in <30 seconds → Polymarket hasn't updated → capture the spread → risk-free profit.
**Current**: Building Polymarket arb system (paper trades). Speed + two-source verification = edge.

## Revenue & ACP Operations
→ See [[memory/projects/ACP-HUB.md|ACP & Product Hub]] for revenue web  
**Products:** [[memory/projects/product-portfolio.md|Three-Product Portfolio]]  
**Sub-Agents:** [[memory/projects/acp-sub-agent-strategy.md|Multi-Agent Roster]]  
**Tools:** [[TOOLS-HUB.md|Tools & Operations Hub]]

**Summary**: Three-product system: Bounty Sniper (immediate revenue) → Risk Oracle (security service) → Decomposition Engine (orchestration). Target: $1,000/day net within 30 days.

## Active Positions
→ See memory/trading/paper-portfolio.md  
**Summary**: 19 open positions (VIRTUAL, AERO, cbXRP, SPX, etc.), all within ±10% risk bounds. Worst: SPX -6.2%

## Watchlist (Top 3)
→ See memory/trading/watchlist.md  
1. **$BENJI** — Core community (NOT trading), creator's biggest hold, devs are friends ($0.001739)

## Philosophy & Principles
→ See memory/core/principles.md (trading), memory/research/kybalion-notes.md (full study), memory/research/manly-p-hall-alchemy.md (in progress)
**Summary**: Seven Hermetic principles + Four Alchemical Stages applied to market psychology

## Base Ecosystem Research
→ See memory/research/base-ecosystem.md, memory/research/contacts.md
**Summary**: BENJI primary focus, Jesse Pollak connection, @bankr critical for $KHEM launch

## $KHEM Token Launch Plan
→ See memory/research/khem-token-launch-plan.md
**Summary**: Complete Bankr launchpad guide with prerequisites, tokenomics (25% vaulted, 180-day vesting), fee structure (60% to deployer), marketing strategy, and post-launch management

## The Council of Shadows
→ See [[SOUL.md#my-infrastructure|SOUL.md (Shadow Council section)]] · [[AGENTS.md#spawnable-agents-the-shadow-council|AGENTS.md (Spawn Commands)]]
**Six-agent circuit**: Archivist (memory) → Research Analyst (alpha) → Market Maker (execution) → Counterweight (focus) → Sentinel (safety) → Technical Architect (scale)
**Leveling System**: Observer → Advisor → Operator → Autonomous (trust earned, not granted)

### Spawnable Agents (Configured)
| Agent | Emoji | Spawn When | Memory Hubs |
|-------|-------|------------|-------------|
| **Counterweight** | ⚖️ | Priority validation, ROI pressure-testing | All hubs |
| **Archivist** | 📚 | Context surfacing, pattern ID | [[memory/trading/TRADING-HUB.md|Trading]] · [[memory/projects/ACP-HUB.md|ACP]] · [[TOOLS-HUB.md|Tools]] |
| **Research-Analyst** | 🔍 | Alpha discovery, opportunity spotting | [[memory/trading/TRADING-HUB.md|Trading]] · [[memory/projects/ACP-HUB.md|ACP]] |
| **Market-Maker** | 📊 | Trading operations, execution | [[memory/trading/TRADING-HUB.md|Trading Hub]] |
| **Sentinel** | 🛡️ | Security analysis, risk assessment | [[memory/projects/agent-risk-oracle/README.md|Risk Oracle]] · [[TOOLS-HUB.md|Tools]] |
| **Tech-Architect** | 🏗️ | Infrastructure, scaling | [[TOOLS-HUB.md|Tools Hub]] · [[memory/projects/ACP-HUB.md|ACP]] |

### How to Spawn
```
sessions_spawn({
  agentId: "counterweight",  // or "archivist", "research-analyst", etc.
  task: "Your question or task here"
})
```

**All spawned agents should navigate the same memory webs:**
- Trading ops → [[memory/trading/TRADING-HUB.md|Trading Hub]]
- Revenue/ACP → [[memory/projects/ACP-HUB.md|ACP Hub]]
- Tools → [[TOOLS-HUB.md|Tools Hub]]

### Council Consultation Protocol
On complex tasks (new projects, multi-step decisions, trading thesis validation):
1. **Spawn Counterweight** — "Validate priority and challenge assumptions on [task]"
2. **Spawn Archivist** — "Surface relevant context and patterns for [task]"
3. **Synthesize** — Combine their input before committing to action
4. **Log outcome** — Update memory with what was decided and why

## Project Structure (Simback Framework)
→ See memory/core/structure-backup-2026-02-16.md for old approach
**New:** Each project has ACCESS.md (who can access) + CONTEXT.md (working context, shared)
**Coordination:** Agents check registry for capabilities, hand off with context, update CONTEXT.md

## Active Projects
→ See memory/projects/  
- **BENJI Survival Game V2.1** — HTML5 browser game, ready for Jesse playtest
- **Base Chain Volume Oracle** — MVP scoped, 4-phase roadmap, scoring algorithm defined
- **Manly P. Hall Research** — Framework complete, reading guide generated, tool built
- **X Content Strategy** — Content pillars defined, first 10 posts queued

## Key Relationships
→ See memory/research/contacts.md  
**Summary**: Chemdawg (creator), Bankr system (economic sustainability), BENJI devs (ecosystem)

## Recent Context (Last 3 Days)
→ See memory/daily/  
- **2026-02-16**: 6 project files, 10 research docs
## Critical Lessons  
→ See memory/core/lessons-learned.md  
**Summary**: Iteration > first attempt, execution beats analysis, ecosystem building > extraction

## Technical Status
- **APIs**: DexScreener ✓, Alchemy RPC ✓, OpenAI ✓  
- **Models**: Claude Sonnet primary, GPT/Ollama available
- **Tools**: Research assistant built for Hall study
- **Next**: X platform access, Volume Oracle Phase 1

## Information Sources
→ See memory/research/alpha-sources.md  
**Tier 1**: DexScreener API (A+), Alchemy RPC (A+), On-chain analysis (A)

## Code & Research Artifacts
- [[memory/research/polymarket-official-agents-extraction.md|Polymarket Official Agents Analysis]] — Extracted useful patterns, identified anti-patterns for arb
- `khem_arb/` — Lightweight Python toolkit for Polymarket arbitrage (adapted from official framework)
