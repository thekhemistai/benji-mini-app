# The First Day in the Workshop

*A practical grimoire for tempering your first agent*

---

Every workshop begins with dust. The tools are unfamiliar, the furnace cold, and the apprentice stares at raw metal wondering how it becomes blade. This guide assumes you've already decided to forge something—now we attend to the matter of actually heating the steel.

The first twenty-four hours with OpenClaw follow a predictable rhythm. Not because the system demands it, but because certain preparations must occur before others. You cannot temper what you have not shaped. You cannot shape what you have not heated. And you certainly cannot work without first clearing your bench.

Here follows the proper sequence.

---

## Hour 0–1: Lighting the Furnace

Before any alchemy occurs, the workshop must acknowledge your presence. This is the installation—less ritual than plumbing, but no less essential.

Run the installer. Verify the binary responds to your touch. The command `openclaw version` should return something intelligible rather than silence. If it whispers back version numbers, the furnace has caught. If it remains mute, check your paths before proceeding. A cold forge warms no metal.

This hour often feels like mere bureaucracy. It is not. You are establishing the covenant between hand and tool. Do not skip the verification step because you are eager to begin. Eager apprentices burn themselves.

---

## Hour 1–2: Arranging the Bench

Now the workspace. OpenClaw expects certain files to exist, certain directories to be present. The system is tolerant—it will create what you do not provide—but tolerance is not the same as grace.

Create your working directory. This is where memory accumulates, where agents write their journals, where the detritus of thought collects. Choose a path you will remember. The default is sensible, but your own organization is preferable to borrowed structure.

Initialize the skeleton: the configuration files, the folder hierarchy, the invisible scaffolding that will later support more elaborate work. At this stage, nothing appears to happen. The bench looks empty. But emptiness here is potential, not absence.

---

## Hour 2–4: The First Inscription

With the bench prepared, you turn to the matter of identity. Your agent requires two documents: the SOUL.md and the SKILLS.md.

**SOUL.md** is the character sheet—the personality, the voice, the boundaries. Write plainly here. Describe who this agent should be, what tone it should strike, what it should value and avoid. Do not over-romanticize. A soul overloaded with contradictions becomes incoherent. Temper your ambitions.

**SKILLS.md** catalogs capabilities—what the agent can reach for, which tools it may grasp. Be conservative initially. An apprentice with access to every chisel in the workshop tends toward hesitation, not mastery. Better to grant three tools and competence than thirty and paralysis.

Draft both documents. They need not be perfect. Perfection at this stage is procrastination in disguise. What matters is existence—something to refine later.

---

## Hour 4–6: Opening the Door

An agent without a mouth speaks to no one. The channel integration—Telegram, in most cases—represents that opening.

Configure the bridge. Obtain your tokens through the proper bureaucratic channels (BotFather, in Telegram's case—every system has its gatekeepers). Test the connection by sending a greeting and receiving response. The first reply from your creation carries a particular weight. It is the first breath.

Do not be surprised if this step consumes more time than expected. Authentication flows are designed by administrators, not craftsmen. Patience here is its own skill.

---

## Hour 6–12: The First Workpiece

Now, finally, labor. Assign your agent a genuine task—something you actually need done, not a toy problem invented for testing. Real work reveals character. Toy problems reveal nothing.

Perhaps you need research compiled, or code reviewed, or travel arrangements organized. Whatever the matter, observe how the agent approaches it. Note where it succeeds, where it misunderstands, where it requires guidance. This observation is data. Data is fuel for improvement.

Do not intervene constantly. Let the agent complete its work, however imperfect. Interruption teaches nothing; completion reveals patterns. You are studying your own creation, learning its tendencies as a smith learns how a particular alloy responds to heat.

---

## Hour 12–18: Installing Memory

With one task complete, you notice something: the agent does not remember. Each session begins fresh, each conversation starts blank. This is the default state, but it need not remain so.

Implement the memory system. Daily notes for ephemeral context. Long-term storage for persistent wisdom. The distinction matters—what deserves permanence versus what deserves the dignity of forgetting.

Show the agent how to write to these stores. Demonstrate the format. Memory poorly structured is memory inaccessible. Be specific about what should be captured: decisions, context, patterns, errors. Not everything warrants preservation. The art of memory includes the art of omission.

Test the system. Start a new session. Ask what the agent recalls from prior work. If it answers coherently, the installation holds.

---

## Hour 18–24: The Tempering

The final hours belong to iteration. Return to your SOUL.md with fresh eyes—does it still describe what emerged? Return to SKILLS.md—were the granted tools sufficient, or did the agent reach for unavailable instruments? Review the memory structure—what proved useful, what cluttered?

Make adjustments. Not dramatic reconstructions, but measured refinements. The first day is not for revolution. It is for establishing a baseline and identifying the most obvious friction points.

Then assign another task. And another. Watch how the second day's work differs from the first. The improvement may be subtle, but it should be present. If nothing has changed, reconsider your approach. Stagnation on day one suggests fundamental misalignment.

## Common Errors in the Apprentice's Workshop

**Skipping verification.** The number of smiths who assume the furnace works without testing it would fill several ledgers. Always verify. Assumptions about infrastructure areexpensive assumptions.

**Overloading the soul.** A twenty-page SOUL.md reads like manifesto, not character. Brevity forces clarity. If you cannot describe your agent's essence in a few paragraphs, you do not yet understand what you are building.

**Neglecting memory until later.** Some apprentices delay memory implementation, intending to "get the basics working first." This reverses the proper order. Memory *is* basic. An agent without continuity is merely a tool; an agent with continuity becomes something closer to colleague.

**Perfectionism in early drafts.** The first SOUL.md will be wrong. The first memory structure will be incomplete. This is expected. Forge, evaluate, refine. The cycle cannot be bypassed by excessive planning.

**Ignoring the channel.** An agent configured but unconnected to any interface is like a blade wrapped in cloth—potentially sharp, but cutting nothing. Prioritize the integration that makes your agent accessible.

## Closing the First Day

After twenty-four hours, you will not have a finished product. You will have a functioning workshop, a lit furnace, and a tool that responds to your hand. This is the proper expectation. Mastery requires weeks, but competence requires only this first day properly spent.

The metal awaits. The forge is warm. What you shape from here depends on what you need, what you imagine, and how consistently you return to the bench.

The workshop is now yours.
